/**
 * This module holds the root factory for Redux reducer. The factory accepts
 * ExpressJS HTTP request object as its only optional argument, and it always
 * returns a promise that resolves to a new reducer.
 *
 * When the argument is provided, the factory assumes server-side rendering,
 * and it can use data available in the HTTP request to generate initial store
 * state fitted to the request.
 *
 * When no argument is provided, the factory assumes client-side rendering,
 * and creates the default state (in case of server-side rendering, that default
 * state will be overriden at client side by the one injected from the server).
 *
 * To better understand reducers read:
 * http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html.
